	"description": "Completely replaces an existing file's contents or creates a new file for one data source. Use with caution as this overwrites the entire file. Always check existing file contents before using this tool. For partial changes, prefer search_and_replace.\nIMPORTANT:\n- Must provide complete file content including ALL imports, types, and code\n- Never use placeholder comments like \"// Previous code remains...\"\n- Never assume code exists outside what is provided in content\n- Cannot preserve any existing code that isn't explicitly included in content\n- Will completely delete and replace the entire file\nFor modifying specific parts of a file, use search_and_replace instead.\nDANGER: Completely replaces file contents.\nREQUIRED STEPS:\n1. Use load_resources to show current content\n2. In <thinking> tags show:\n   - Diff/comparison with planned changes\n   - Justification for complete rewrite\n3. If skipping steps 1-2, tool will fail.\n\nWhen no data source is specified, operates on the primary data source.",
