	"description": "Run a system command from the user-configured allow list and return the output. For security, only commands explicitly added to the allow list can be executed. Users can configure any shell commands they wish to permit. If you need a command that isn't in the allowed list, suggest that the user add it to their configuration. Commands may output to both stdout and stderr; stderr doesn't always indicate an error. Commands can be run from a specific working directory relative to the project root, which affects how relative paths in arguments are resolved. If no working directory is specified, commands run from the project root. The tool supports output truncation through the outputTruncation parameter, allowing you to keep specified numbers of lines from the beginning (head) and/or end (tail) of both stdout and stderr outputs. When truncation occurs, the response includes truncatedInfo detailing how many lines were kept from the original output.",
