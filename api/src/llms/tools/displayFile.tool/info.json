IMPORTANT: Do not use this tool to return file contents to the AI assistant; instead use the request_file tool.\n\nThe tool will show the user the file contents with appropriate formatting (syntax highlighting for text files, proper rendering for images) but the AI will only receive metadata like file size, type, and last modified date. This separation ensures user privacy while allowing the AI to track file states and metadata.",
