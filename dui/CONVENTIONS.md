# BB Desktop User Interface (DUI) Component Conventions

## Overview
This document outlines specific conventions for the BB Desktop User Interface component. These conventions MUST be followed in addition to the general project conventions.

## Architecture
- Built with Tauri
- React/TypeScript frontend
- Rust backend integration
- BUI webview integration

## Questions for Enhancement
1. Are there specific UI/UX patterns for desktop?
2. Are there required native feature integrations?
3. Are there specific security requirements?
4. Are there performance benchmarks?
5. Are there platform-specific requirements?
