## Why Beyond Better?

In a world where AI assistants are becoming commonplace, Beyond Better stands out by offering a more comprehensive, project-wide approach to content creation and management. Born from the need for a more versatile and powerful tool than existing solutions, Beyond Better (BB) brings the full potential of large language models (LLMs) directly to your projects.

### Key Features

- **Universal Text Support**: From code to prose, Beyond Better handles it all.
- **First-Class Project Discussions**: Makes conversations about your project as important as the changes themselves.
- **Conversation Management**: Handles multiple conversations simultaneously for complex projects.
- **Intelligent Tools**: Employs LLM tools for clear, purpose-driven interactions.
- **Custom Tools**: Extend BB's capabilities with tools from the BB Tool Library or create your own.
- **Web Page Fetching**: The `FetchWebPage` tool allows Beyond Better to retrieve content from web pages, providing additional context and information for the LLM to reference during conversations.
- **Web Page Screenshot**: The `FetchWebScreenshot` tool enables Beyond Better to capture screenshots of web pages, allowing the LLM to analyze visual content when needed.
- **Project-Wide Understanding**: Uses project file listing for initial project comprehension, with plans for advanced techniques like RAG and embeddings in the future.
- **Multiple Interface Options**: API, Browser User Interface (BUI), Command Line Interface (CLI), and future Desktop User Interface (DUI) for flexible usage.

## Getting Started

### BB Manager

BB Manager is a platform-specific tool designed to help you manage multiple BB projects efficiently:

- **Windows**: `bb-manager.bat` - A batch script with a text-based menu interface.
- **macOS**: `BB Manager.applescript` - An AppleScript application providing a native GUI.
- **Linux**: `bb-manager.sh` - A shell script with a text-based menu interface.

BB Manager allows you to:
- List, add, and remove BB projects
- Run BB commands (init, start, stop) for specific projects
- Automatically set the correct working directory for each project

To use BB Manager, run the appropriate file for your platform after installation.

### Prerequisites

Before using Beyond Better (BB), ensure you have the following:

1. An Anthropic API key (Note: This is different from your Anthropic chat console login. You'll need to create an API key at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (latest stable version, recommended but optional)

Git can be easily installed using package managers like Homebrew on macOS, Chocolatey on Windows, or apt on Linux. While Git is optional, it's highly recommended for optimal use of Beyond Better.

Beyond Better includes built-in TLS certificate management:
- Automatic certificate generation and trust store integration
- Secure HTTPS communication out of the box
- Easy management with `bb secure` command
- Platform-specific trust store handling

See the [Certificate Management Guide](docs/user/security/certificates.md) for details.

### Installation

Beyond Better can be installed on various platforms:

- **macOS and Linux**: Use our one-line installation script:
  ```sh
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beyond-Better/bb/main/install.sh | sh
  ```

- **Windows**: Download and run the `bb-installer.msi` from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Beyond-Better/bb/releases). For detailed instructions, see our [Windows User Guide](docs/user/guides/windows_guide.md).

- **Manual Installation**: For advanced users, we provide options to install from release packages or build from source.

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to our [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

After installation, you can start using Beyond Better as follows:

1. Use BB Manager to add and manage your projects:
   - Windows: Run `bb-manager.bat`
   - macOS: Open `BB Manager.applescript`
   - Linux: Run `bb-manager.sh`

2. Use BB Manager to initialize a new project:
   Select 'Run BB command' and choose 'init' for your project.

3. Use BB Manager to start BB for a specific project:
   Select 'Run BB command' and choose 'start' for your project.

4. Alternatively, you can use BB directly from the command line:
   ```
   bb init   # Initialize BB in the current directory
   bb start  # Start the BB API and open the browser interface
   bb chat   # Start the BB API and use the command-line interface
   ```

On Windows, use `bb.exe` instead of `bb` when using the command line directly.
