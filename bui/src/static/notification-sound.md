# Placeholder for notification sound file

This should be replaced with an actual MP3 file for audio notifications.
You can use any short (1-3 second) pleasant notification sound.

Recommended sources:

- freesound.org (CC0 licensed sounds)
- zapsplat.com (with account)
- Custom recording

Suggested characteristics:

- Duration: 1-3 seconds
- Pleasant, non-jarring tone
- Clear but not loud
- Distinctive enough to be recognizable

Example sounds that work well:

- Gentle chime
- Soft bell
- Positive beep
- Brief musical note

For now, the system will gracefully fall back to the HTML Audio API
with a data URL or external sound file if this file is missing.
