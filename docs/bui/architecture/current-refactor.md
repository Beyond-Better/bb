# BUI Refactoring Guide

## Overview

The Beyond Better Browser User Interface (BUI) is undergoing a significant refactoring to support future growth into a full SaaS product. This document uses the Chat interface refactoring as a case study to demonstrate patterns and considerations for future development.

## Key Objectives

1. Modularize monolithic components
2. Implement proper state management
3. Support multiple islands
4. Establish patterns for testing
5. Enable future feature expansion

## Fresh/Island Considerations

### Island Architecture
- Islands are isolated JavaScript components
- State sharing between islands requires careful planning
- Not all React patterns are available
- Focus on web standards over framework-specific solutions

### Fresh-Specific Limitations
- No shared state between islands by default
- Limited client-side routing
- Different component lifecycle than React
- Server-side rendering considerations

## Current Refactoring Pattern

### Component Structure
```
islands/
  Chat.tsx               # Main island component
hooks/
  useChatState.ts       # State management
types/
  chat.types.ts         # Type definitions
utils/
  websocketManager.utils.ts   # WebSocket handling
```

### State Management Pattern
- Local state within islands where possible
- Signals for reactive state
- Clear initialization sequence
- WebSocket state handling
- URL parameter management

### Code Organization
1. Types and interfaces
2. Initialization utilities
3. State management hooks
4. Main component logic

## Development Patterns

### State Initialization
1. Extract configuration (URL params, env vars)
2. Initialize services (API, WebSocket)
3. Set up state management
4. Handle cleanup

### Event Handling
1. WebSocket events
2. User interactions
3. State changes
4. Error conditions

### Error Management
1. Type-safe error handling
2. User feedback
3. Recovery strategies
4. Logging

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Multiple island support
- State sharing requirements
- Component reuse
- Performance optimization

### Feature Expansion
- User settings
- Project management
- Billing integration
- Team collaboration

## Best Practices

1. Island-First Design
   - Consider island boundaries early
   - Plan state isolation
   - Handle inter-island communication

2. State Management
   - Keep state local when possible
   - Use signals for reactivity
   - Plan for state sharing carefully

3. Type Safety
   - Define clear interfaces
   - Use TypeScript strictly
   - Maintain type consistency

4. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error states
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Recovery mechanisms

5. Testing Considerations
   - Island-specific testing
   - State management testing
   - WebSocket testing
   - Component isolation

## Next Steps

1. Review [State Management](../architecture/state-management.md)
2. Implement [Testing Strategy](../testing/strategy.md)
3. Plan [Project Management](../features/project-management.md)
4. Consider [User Settings](../features/user-settings.md)
