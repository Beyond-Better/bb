# Managing BB Conversations

Learn how to effectively manage conversations with BB for optimal results and cost efficiency.

## When to Start New Conversations

Starting new conversations helps maintain focus and manage costs. Consider starting new when:

- Switching to a different aspect of your project
- After completing a significant task
- When approaching token limits
- When changing direction or strategy

> **Pro Tip**: Use markdown files outside of BB to document your plan and create clear instructions for new conversations. This helps maintain consistency across multiple sessions while keeping a historical record.

## Using the Conversation Summary Tool

### When to Use

- Long conversations approaching token limits
- After completing a major phase of work
- Before starting a new but related task
- When conversation context becomes too large

### How to Use

The conversation summary tool can be accessed:

- Via the toolbar button
- By asking BB to summarize the conversation
- Automatically when approaching token limits

### Summary Options:

- **Short**: Essential points only
- **Medium**: Balanced detail
- **Long**: Comprehensive record

## Managing Token Usage and Costs

Token usage directly affects costs. Here's how to manage it effectively:

### Cost-saving Strategies

- Remove unnecessary files from context
- Use conversation summaries regularly
- Break large tasks into smaller conversations
- Start fresh conversations for new tasks

### Things to Avoid

- Keeping too many files in context
- Running conversations too long
- Mixing unrelated tasks
- Ignoring token usage warnings

## Using Markdown for Planning

Keep markdown files outside BB for better planning and documentation:

- Maintain historical reference of decisions
- Create clear instructions for new conversations
- Document different aspects of complex tasks
- Share plans and progress with team members

### Workflow Example:

1. Start planning conversation with BB
2. Discuss options and approaches
3. Ask BB to document the plan in markdown
4. Save markdown file outside BB
5. Use markdown to seed new focused conversations
