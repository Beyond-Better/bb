# Beyond Better: Data Sources and Tools

## Additional Core Tools for Project Assistant

Beyond content manipulation, BB should include specialized tools with clear interaction patterns between the LLM and the tool. Each tool has a distinct flow of information that determines whether the tool primarily provides data TO the LLM, receives content FROM the LLM, or involves balanced bidirectional interaction.

### Tools Primarily Providing Data TO the LLM (Tool → LLM)

These tools perform complex analysis or data gathering and return rich information that the LLM then interprets, synthesizes, and explains to the user.

  }
  LLM: "I've assigned tasks for Sprint 12, but noted that Bob is overloaded. Would you like me to reassign some of his tasks?"
  ```

This comprehensive breakdown demonstrates the variety of interaction patterns across different tool types, showing how each tool serves a specific purpose in the BB ecosystem with a clear definition of what the tool does versus what the LLM contributes.

## Comparison with Current Tools

The current tools provide good foundational capabilities but lack some higher-level functionalities:

- **Repository Analysis:** Current tools like `load_datasource` and `search_project` handle basic discovery but don't analyze relationships or dependencies

- **Search & Context:** Current `search_project` is pattern-based rather than semantic and doesn't unify across multiple data sources

- **Documentation Generation:** No dedicated tool exists for automatic documentation generation
