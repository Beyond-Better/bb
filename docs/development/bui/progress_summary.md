# BUI Enhancement Project Progress Summary

## Current Status
This document summarizes the progress of the BUI enhancement project, capturing key decisions and architectural changes. Use this as a starting point for new implementation conversations.

## Latest Changes

### 1. WebSocket Architecture
Implemented dual WebSocket connections with clear separation:
- App-level: `/v1/ws/app` for global features and version info
- Chat-level: `/v1/ws/conversation/<id>` for chat features

Each connection:
- Maintains its own state
- Handles its own errors independently
- Operates independently without race conditions

### 2. State Management
Completed separation of app and chat state:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[App State] --> B[WebSocket /v1/ws/app]
    A --> C[Global Features]
    A --> D[Version Info]
    E[Chat State] --> F[WebSocket /v1/ws/conversation/id]
    E --> G[Chat Features]
```

Key characteristics:
- States operate independently
- No waiting dependencies between states
- Separate error handling
- Version info moved to app state

### 3. Component Architecture
- AppStateProvider added as root-level island
- SideNav updated to use app state
- Chat updated to use app state for version info
- Shared status display components

## Implementation Status

### 1. Completed Features
- WebSocket manager base implementation
- App-specific WebSocket manager
- Chat-specific WebSocket manager
- App state implementation
- Version info management in app state
- State separation architecture

### 2. In Progress
- Testing for regressions in chat island
- Moving conversation header elements to conversation metadata

### 3. Pending Work
- Regression testing
- Component updates
- Documentation updates

## Component Integration

### 1. AppStateProvider
```typescript
// Root-level island that manages app state
function AppStateProvider({ wsUrl, apiUrl }: AppStateProviderProps) {
    // Initializes app-level WebSocket
    // Manages version info and global state
}
```

### 2. State Dependencies
- App and chat states operate independently
- No waiting dependencies between states
- Each handles its own errors
- Version info managed by app state only

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant Chat
    
    Note over App: App-level error occurs
    App->>User: Show error in global context
    Note over Chat: Chat continues functioning
    
    Note over Chat: Chat-level error occurs
    Chat->>User: Show error in chat context
    Note over App: App continues functioning
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Tasks
- Test for regressions in chat island
- Move conversation header elements to metadata
- Update documentation

### 2. Short-term Goals
- Complete regression testing
- Enhance error handling
- Update component organization

### 3. Long-term Objectives
- Enhance project features
