# ChatInput Auto-save Implementation Status

## Current State

### What Works
1. Auto-save is triggering:
   - Saves to localStorage on input changes
   - Uses correct key format: `bb-chat-current-{conversationId}`
   - Logs show successful saves
   - Data is present in localStorage after save

### What Doesn't Work
1. Input restoration after page refresh:
   - Input is not being restored despite being saved
   - Logs show restoration attempts
   - Saved data exists in localStorage

## Implementation Details

### Storage Keys
```typescript
// Current format
const currentInputKey = `bb-chat-current-${conversationId}`;
```

### Save Operation
```typescript
// Working - saves successfully
saveCurrentInput(value: string) {
  if (value.trim().length >= MIN_INPUT_LENGTH) {
    localStorage.setItem(currentInputKey, value);
  }
}
```

### Restore Operation (Not Working)
```typescript
// Current implementation that's failing
useEffect(() => {
  const saved = getSavedInput();
  if (saved && !value) {
    onChange(saved);
  }
}, [conversationId]);
```

## Identified Issues

1. Timing Problems:
   - Restoration might be happening before conversation ID is ready
   - Signal updates might be out of sync
   - Multiple effects might be interfering

2. State Management:
   - Unclear when conversationId signal is initialized
   - Potential race conditions between effects
   - Possible issues with signal updates

3. Component Lifecycle:
   - Mount effect might be too early
   - Conversation change effect might override restoration
   - Cleanup might be affecting state

## Attempted Solutions

1. Added Initialization Delay:
   ```typescript
   setTimeout(initializeInput, 100);
   ```
   - Didn't resolve the issue
   - Might indicate deeper timing problem

2. Added Signal Synchronization:
   ```typescript
   conversationIdSignal.value = conversationId;
   ```
   - Signal updates working
   - Still not triggering restoration

3. Added More Validation:
   ```typescript
   if (saved && !value.trim()) {
     onChange(saved);
   }
   ```
   - Better validation
   - Still not restoring input

## Next Steps

1. Investigation Needed:
   - Track full lifecycle of conversation ID
   - Monitor signal update timing
   - Add more detailed logging
   - Check component mount order

2. Potential Solutions to Try:
   - Move restoration to parent component
   - Use different storage mechanism
   - Implement state machine for lifecycle
   - Add explicit initialization phase

3. Testing Requirements:
   - Add unit tests for storage operations
   - Add integration tests for restoration
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Test different timing scenarios

## Performance Considerations

1. Current Monitoring:
   - Added keystroke timing
   - Added render counting
   - Added operation logging

2. Identified Issues:
   - Multiple effect triggers
   - Possible unnecessary renders
   - Storage operation timing

3. Future Improvements:
   - Batch storage operations
   - Optimize effect dependencies
   - Add render memoization

## Documentation Needed

1. Storage Format:
   - Document key structure
   - Document value format
   - Document cleanup process

2. Lifecycle Events:
   - Document initialization sequence
   - Document restoration timing
   - Document cleanup process

3. Error Handling:
   - Document recovery procedures
   - Document error states
   - Document user recovery options

## Questions for Next Session

1. Component Lifecycle:
   - When exactly is conversationId available?
   - What triggers conversation changes?
   - What's the expected mount sequence?

2. State Management:
   - Should we use a different state strategy?
   - How to handle race conditions?
   - How to ensure signal synchronization?

3. Testing Strategy:
   - What test cases are critical?
   - How to test timing issues?
   - How to verify storage operations?
