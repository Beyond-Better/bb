# BB Objectives System

## Overview

BB uses a hierarchical objectives system to maintain context and guide decision-making throughout collaborations. This system helps both the LLM and users stay focused on immediate tasks while maintaining alignment with broader collaboration goals.

## Objective Types

### Collaboration Goals
- Generated at the start of each collaboration
- Provides overall context and purpose
- Remains consistent throughout the collaboration
- Used for strategic decision-making
- Example: "Analyze and improve the error handling in the project's file operations"

### Statement Objectives
- Generated for each user statement
- Stored as an ordered array matching statement count
- Last objective is always the current focus
- Used for immediate task guidance
- Examples:
  1. "Search for all error handling code in file operation utilities"
  2. "Analyze the error patterns in the found files"
  3. "Implement consistent error handling across file operations"

## Implementation Details

### Generation
- Collaboration goals are generated only at collaboration start
- Statement objectives are generated for each new user statement
- Both use separate LLM interactions to maintain focus
- Statement objectives consider the collaboration goal for context

### Storage
- Objectives are stored with collaboration metadata
- Statement objectives maintain an ordered history
- Length of statement objectives array matches statement count
- Both types persist across session breaks

### Display
- Both objectives appear in tool feedback
- Current objective is always the last statement objective
- Tool feedback format:
  ```
  Tool results feedback:
  Turn X/Y
  Collaboration Goal: [overall purpose]
  Current Objective: [immediate task]
  [tool results]
  ```

## Usage Contexts

### For LLMs
1. Decision Making:
   - Use collaboration goal for strategic choices
   - Use current objective for tactical decisions
   - Consider both when selecting tools
   - Frame responses in proper context

2. Tool Usage:
   - Choose tools that align with both objectives
   - Include relevant objectives in result analysis
   - Track progress through tool feedback
   - Maintain context across multiple tool uses

3. Response Framing:
   - Reference objectives in explanations
   - Keep responses aligned with current focus
   - Connect immediate tasks to broader goals
   - Maintain consistency across turns

### For Users
1. Collaboration Structure:
   - Start with clear overall goals
   - Break down into specific statements
   - Monitor objective progression
   - Adjust course as needed

2. Task Management:
   - Use objectives to track progress
   - Ensure tasks align with goals
   - Review objective history
   - Guide collaboration flow

## Best Practices

1. Objective Creation:
   - Make collaboration goals specific but broad enough
   - Keep statement objectives focused and actionable
   - Ensure objectives are measurable
   - Use clear, concise language

2. Context Maintenance:
   - Review objectives regularly
   - Check alignment between levels
   - Update when focus shifts
   - Maintain objective history

3. Tool Interaction:
   - Use objectives to guide tool selection
   - Review tool feedback for context
   - Align tool usage with objectives
   - Track progress through feedback

## Examples

### Example 1: Code Refactoring
```
Collaboration Goal: Refactor the project's error handling system for better consistency and maintainability
Statement Objectives:
1. "Analyze current error handling patterns in the codebase"
2. "Identify inconsistencies and potential improvements"
3. "Implement standardized error handling utilities"
4. "Update existing code to use new error handling system"
```

### Example 2: Documentation Update
```
Collaboration Goal: Update project documentation to reflect recent API changes
Statement Objectives:
1. "Identify all API-related documentation files"
2. "Review recent API changes in the codebase"
3. "Update API endpoint documentation"
4. "Add new examples for changed endpoints"
```

## Integration Points

1. Tool Feedback:
   - Includes both objective levels
   - Updates after each tool use
   - Maintains context through turns
   - Guides next actions

2. Collaboration Management:
   - Persists objectives with collaboration data
   - Loads objectives with collaboration history
   - Tracks objective progression
   - Manages objective updates

3. User Interface:
   - Displays current objectives
   - Shows objective history
   - Indicates progress
   - Facilitates context understanding

## Conclusion

The objectives system is a core component of BB that helps maintain focus, context, and progress throughout collaborations. By providing both high-level goals and immediate objectives, it enables more effective collaboration between users and LLMs while ensuring consistent progress toward desired outcomes.
